You can do this in your <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes\">dashboard</a>, but if you prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give you a better chance of winning your dispute. To figure out which evidence fields to provide, see our <a href=\"/docs/disputes/categories\">guide to dispute types</a>.</p>",
