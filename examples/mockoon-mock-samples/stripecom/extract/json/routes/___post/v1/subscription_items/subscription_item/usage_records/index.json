  "documentation": "<p>Creates a usage record for a specified subscription item and date, and fills it with a quantity.</p>\n\n<p>Usage records provide <code>quantity</code> information that Stripe uses to track how much a customer is using your service. With usage information and the pricing model set up by the <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/metered-billing\">metered billing</a> plan, Stripe helps you send accurate invoices to your customers.</p>\n\n<p>The default calculation for usage is to add up all the <code>quantity</code> values of the usage records within a billing period. You can change this default behavior with the billing planâ€™s <code>aggregate_usage</code> <a href=\"/docs/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage\">parameter</a>. When there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe adds the <code>quantity</code> values together. In most cases, this is the desired resolution, however, you can change this behavior with the <code>action</code> parameter.</p>\n\n<p>The default pricing model for metered billing is <a href=\"/docs/api/plans/object#plan_object-billing_scheme\">per-unit pricing</a>. For finer granularity, you can configure metered billing to have a <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/tiers\">tiered pricing</a> model.</p>",
